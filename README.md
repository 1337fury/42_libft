The `libft` project is a project in which you are required to recreate several functions from the C standard library. These functions are typically used for basic string manipulation, memory manipulation, and input/output.

#### Here is a list of some of the functions that you might be asked to implement as part of the libft project:

- `strlen`: calculates the length of a null-terminated string
- `strcpy`: copies a string from one location to another
- `strdup`: creates a copy of a string in a new location
- `strcmp`: compares two strings lexicographically
- `memset`: fills a block of memory with a specific value
- `memcpy`: copies a block of memory from one location to another
- `memmove`: moves a block of memory from one location to another
- `putchar`: outputs a single character to the console
- `putstr`: outputs a string to the console
- `putnbr`: outputs an integer to the console

To complete the libft project, you will need to implement these functions in C. You should also write appropriate unit tests to ensure that your implementations are correct.

It is recommended that you use a modular approach when implementing the libft functions. This means that you should break the functions down into smaller, reusable pieces, and write helper functions as needed. This will make your code easier to read, understand, and debug.

Once you have completed the libft project, you should have a solid foundation in C programming and be well-equipped to tackle more advanced projects.
